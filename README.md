WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About

WTWR is a simple weather app I made using React. It helps decide what to wear based on the weather outside. The app shows the current temperature and gives clothing suggestions for hot, warm, or cold weather. You can also add, view, or delete clothing items from a small collection.

## What It Can Do

**Current Weather** – shows your location, temperature, and weather condition
**Day and Night Mode** – switches visuals automatically based on the time of day
**Outfit Suggestions** – recommends clothes by temperature:

Hot: 86°F and higher
Warm: 66°F–85°F
Cold: below 66°F

**Clothing Items** – lets you view, add, and delete items (each with an image and weather type)
**Responsive Design** – works well on phones and computers
**Pop-up Modals** – used for adding and previewing items, with several ways to close (ESC, click outside, or close button)

**Form Validation** – checks that all fields are filled before adding new items

## Tech I Used

-React 18+ (with hooks like useState and useEffect)
-Vite 5 for running and building the app
-JavaScript (ES6+)
-CSS (BEM style) for cleaner class naming
-OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather info
-Cabinet Grotesk font
-ESLint to keep the code organized

## Notes

I built this project during my software engineering bootcamp as a way to practice React, APIs, and responsive design. I learned a lot about components, props, and managing state while building it.
